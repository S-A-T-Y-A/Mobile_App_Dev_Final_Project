# Wellness Buddy

## Overview

Our Wellness Buddy app is designed to empower users facing health challenges by allowing them to choose their specific health conditions or goals. Users can select their category of problem and connect directly with a Health Coach, who might be a certified professional or a recently studying student specializing in their area of concern. We aim to support users on their wellness journey, helping them take control of their health and improve their overall wellbeing. Our mission is to make professional and student wellness guidance accessible, convenient, and effective for everyone.
