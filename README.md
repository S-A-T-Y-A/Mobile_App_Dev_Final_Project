### Overview

<p style="text-align:justify">
Our Wellness Buddy application is implemented to educate users with health problems in that way that they can choose their health conditions or their main goals. Users can choose their problem and make a direct connection with a Health Coach, which may be a certified professional or a just graduated student who is a specialist in their field of interest. Our focus is to keep users with us on their health journey where they regain their health control and have better wellbeing. Our goal is to provide everyone with affordable, reliable, and efficient career/student counseling services.
