# SkillComrade

## Proposal:

#### Imagine an app called "SkillComrade" that connects people based on skills and location. You create a profile highlighting your skills (e.g., coding, graphic design, photography). When you search, SkillShare uses GPS to find others with similar skills nearby. You'll see profiles with contact information (if users choose to share it) allowing you to connect via call or email for collaboration, mentorship, or even friendship. This app fosters a local community around shared skills. Need help with coding? Find someone nearby! Want to share your photography expertise? SkillShare connects you! It creates a platform for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and building a network based on what you can do.
